===============

A friend of mine subscribed to a windows-based backup service at
www.mypcbackup.com. After upgrading her computer from Windows XP to Ubuntu
Ringtail, I found that there was no way to retrieve her files from the service!
My son and I dashed off this Python script to recursively fetch all the files.
It's not any huge reverse-engineering project, but might save someone an hour.
